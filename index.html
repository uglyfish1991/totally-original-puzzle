    <p>The rules!</p>
    <p>Use your keyboard or the on screen keyboard to guess the secret 5-letter word hiding under the tiles. You've got
      6 guesses. Pay attention to the colour of the borders, they're there to help:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        🟩 Green border: Nailed it. Right letter, right spot.
      </li>
      <li>
        🟨 Yellow border: Almost! The letter is in the word, just not at that spot.
      </li>
      <li>
        ⬛ Black border: Nope. That letter didn't get the grades to join in.
      </li>
    </ul>
<p>
  Letters can show up more than once — just to keep things fun.
</p>

  🔍Each week has a theme! See if you can spot them!
</p>
<p>
  Good luck!
